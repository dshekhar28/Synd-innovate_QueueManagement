# EasyQueue - SYND iNNOVATE
## Automated Queue Management System for Branch.
I propose EasyQueue - a solution for developing Automated Queue Management System for Walk-In-Customer in the Branch with the help of  QR Codes. It will have following features:
1. The customer should be able to scan QR code to get the ticket, which will guide the customer further by informing the counter number to serve him at the earliest.
2. The system shall automatically re-schedule the counter to maintain FIFO order depending on customer requirements.
3. Centralized monitoring system shall analyze the queue data, suggest the Branch to improve turnaround time and rank the branches accordingly.
4. Gathering feedback regarding Ambience & Cleanliness while waiting in the queue.
5. Ranking the branches according to their feedback also.

## Proposed solution
1. An `EasyQueue` mobile application for both Android and iOS.
2. Server application for individual branches.
3. Centralized system for monitoring and recommendation.

Since the server will be distributed, it will be easy to add another system, and the load will be balanced.

### Mobile Applications
The source code can be found in `EasyQueue-MobileApp\EasyQueue`.
More coming soon.

### Branch Server(s)
The code can be found in `Branch_1`, `Branch_2`: The source code is same just different instances to demonstrate two different branches.
More coming soon.

### Central Monitoring system
The code can be found in `Central_Monitor`.
More coming soon.
